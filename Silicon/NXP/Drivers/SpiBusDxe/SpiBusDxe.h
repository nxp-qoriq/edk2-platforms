  Tests to see if this driver supports a given controller. If a child device is provided,
  it further tests to see if this driver supports creating a handle for the specified child device.

  This function checks to see if the driver specified by This supports the device specified by
  ControllerHandle. Drivers will typically use the device path attached to
  ControllerHandle and/or the services from the bus I/O abstraction attached to
  ControllerHandle to determine if the driver supports ControllerHandle. This function
  may be called many times during platform initialization. In order to reduce boot times, the tests
  performed by this function must be very small, and take as little time as possible to execute. This
  function must not change the state of any hardware devices, and this function must be aware that the
  device specified by ControllerHandle may already be managed by the same driver or a
  different driver. This function must match its calls to AllocatePages() with FreePages(),
  AllocatePool() with FreePool(), and OpenProtocol() with CloseProtocol().
  Since ControllerHandle may have been previously started by the same driver, if a protocol is
  already in the opened state, then it must not be closed with CloseProtocol(). This is required
  to guarantee the state of ControllerHandle is not modified by this function.

  @param[in]  This                 A pointer to the EFI_DRIVER_BINDING_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param[in]  ControllerHandle     The handle of the controller to test. This handle
                                   must support a protocol interface that supplies
                                   an I/O abstraction to the driver.
  @param[in]  RemainingDevicePath  A pointer to the remaining portion of a device path.  This
                                   parameter is ignored by device drivers, and is optional for bus
                                   drivers. For bus drivers, if this parameter is not NULL, then
                                   the bus driver must determine if the bus controller specified
                                   by ControllerHandle and the child controller specified
                                   by RemainingDevicePath are both supported by this
                                   bus driver.

                                   driver or an application that requires exclusive access.

/**
  Initiate a SPI transaction between the host and a SPI peripheral.

  This routine must be called at or below TPL_NOTIFY.
  This routine works with the SPI bus layer to pass the SPI transactions to the
  SPI controller for execution on the SPI bus.

  @param[in]  This              Pointer to an EFI_SPI_IO_PROTOCOL structure.
  @param[in]  RequestPacket     Pointer to an EFI_SPI_REQUEST_PACKET
                                structure describing the SPI transactions.

  @param[in]  ClockHz           Specify the ClockHz value as zero (0) to use
                                the maximum clock frequency supported by the
                                SPI controller and part. Specify a non-zero
                                value only when a specific SPI transaction
                                requires a reduced clock rate.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS             The transaction completed successfully.
  @retval EFI_ALREADY_STARTED     The controller is busy with another transaction.
  @retval EFI_BAD_BUFFER_SIZE     The Length value in SPI Transaction is wrong.
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR        There was an SPI error during the transaction.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER   The parameters specified in RequestPacket are not
                                  Valid. or the RequestPacket is NULL.

  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER   The ChipSeLect value or its contents are
                                  invalid
  @retval EFI_NO_RESPONSE         The SPI device is not responding to the slave
                                  address.  EFI_DEVICE_ERROR will be returned if
                                  the controller cannot distinguish when the NACK
                                  occurred.
  @retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED         The controller does not support the requested
                                  transaction. or The SPI controller was not able to support
                                  the frequency requested by ClockHz

  Update the SPI peripheral associated with this SPI 10 instance.
