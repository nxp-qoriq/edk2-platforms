Tiano EDK1 Build Instructions for Intel(R) PRO/1000 Network Connections Driver
Copyright 2008-2010, Intel Corporation, All Rights Reserved


INSTRUCTIONS
============
  The make files included in this source package allow the PRO/1000 driver
  binary to be built as part of the Tiano Core EDK1 source tree.  Before
  building the driver you must download the Tiano Core EDK1 release source
  from www.tianocore.org and build the tree for your target architecture
  following the instructions from that site.
  Follow the below steps to integrate the PRO/1000 driver into the Tiano Core
  source tree:

  1. Unzip all files into the following EDK1 sub-directory:
     \Sample\Bus\Pci\GigUndi

  2a. (x86-64 or x86 UEFI builds) Open the file X64.dsc in the sub-directory
  \Sample\Platform\X64\Build.   Add the following line to the file in the
  section labeled "# Network Boot": Sample\Bus\Pci\GigUndi\gig_edk1.inf
  This will add the PRO/1000 driver to the list of targets for the EDK1 build
  process. The X64.dsc file has separate sections for x86 and x86-64 builds.
  The reference to the gig_edk1.inf file must be placed in the correct section
  for the target architecture, or placed in both sections to build for both
  x86 and x86-64 architectures.

  2b. (Itanium IPF Build) Open the file IPF.dsc in the sub-directory
  \Sample\Platform\IPF\Build.  Add the following line to the list of targets in
  the file: Sample\Bus\Pci\GigUndi\gig_edk1.inf

  3. Run "nmake" from the platform \Sample\Platform\<ARCH> directory.  This 
  will build the EDK1 source tree including the PRO/1000 driver.  The resultant
  executable, gigundi.efi, will be created in the .UEFI\IPF, .UEFI\X64, or 
  .UEFI\IA32 sub-directory depending on the target architecture.


CONTROLLER SPECIFIC BUILD INSTRUCTIONS (OPTIONAL)
=================================================
  Two example *.inf build files are included with the PRO/1000 source which
  create a driver binary supporting only a specific network controller family.
  These *.inf file will result in a smaller binary size by excluding code not
  needed by the controller.

  gig_82575_edk1.inf: This file will generate a driver specific to the 82575
  family of network controllers.  To build a driver specific to the 82575
  controller, follow the build instructions in the previous section, but
  replace "gig_edk1.inf" with "gig_82575_edk1.inf".

  gig_ich_edk1.inf:  This file will generate a driver specific to the ICH
  LAN-On-Motherboard network connections such as ICH8, and ICH9.  To build a
  driver specific to ICH network connections, follow the build instructions in
  the previous section, but replace "gig_edk1.inf" with "gig_ich_edk1.inf".

  gig_edk1.inf: This file will generate a driver supporting all Intel PRO/1000
  network connections.  To generate this driver binary follow the build
  instructions in the previous section.
