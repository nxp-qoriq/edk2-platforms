  From two values retrieved with TimerLib's GetPerformanceCounter(), calculate
  the number of ticks elapsed between them, such that the difference can be
  passed to TimerLib's GetTimeInNanoSecond().

  The function cannot handle multiple wrap-arounds of the performance counter.

  @param[in] PerfCounterStart  The value returned by GetPerformanceCounter(),
                               called earlier in wall clock time.

                               called later in wall clock time.

  @retval  The number of ticks corresponding to the conceptual difference
           (PerfCounterStop-PerfCounterStart).
