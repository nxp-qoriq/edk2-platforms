  Retrieve the Platform specific configuration data for a SPI device.

  @param[in] Key        Pointer to an SPI_PERIPHERAL_CONFIG_KEY data structure.
                        Key contains the SPI controller information as well as SPI device chip select number
  @param[out] Value     Pointer to an SPI_CONFIGURATION_DATA data structure.
                        The SPI_CONFIG_MAP is searched for the Key and corresponding Value is copied in
                        memory pointed to by Value. It is the responsibility of caller of this function to
                        allocate memory for SPI_CONFIGURATION_DATA.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS             The configuration data was retrieved successfully.
  @retval EFI_NOT_FOUND           no configuration data found for the SPI device
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER   either Key or Value is NULL
