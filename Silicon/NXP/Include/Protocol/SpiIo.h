/**
  Initiate a SPI transaction between the host and a SPI peripheral.

  This routine must be called at or below TPL_NOTIFY.
  This routine works with the SPI bus layer to pass the SPI transactions to the
  SPI controller for execution on the SPI bus.

  @param[in]  This              Pointer to an EFI_SPI_IO_PROTOCOL structure.
  @param[in]  RequestPacket     Pointer to an EFI_SPI_REQUEST_PACKET
                                structure describing the SPI transactions.

  @param[in]  ClockHz           Specify the ClockHz value as zero (0) to use
                                the maximum clock frequency supported by the
                                SPI controller and part. Specify a non-zero
                                value only when a specific SPI transaction
                                requires a reduced clock rate.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS             The transaction completed successfully.
  @retval EFI_ALREADY_STARTED     The controller is busy with another transaction.
  @retval EFI_BAD_BUFFER_SIZE     The Length value in SPI Transaction is wrong.
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR        There was an SPI error during the transaction.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER   The parameters specified in RequestPacket are not
                                  Valid. or the RequestPacket is NULL.
  @retval EFI_NOT_READY           Support for the chip select is not properly
                                  initialized
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER   The ChipSeLect value or its contents are
                                  invalid
  @retval EFI_NO_RESPONSE         The SPI device is not responding to the slave
                                  address.  EFI_DEVICE_ERROR will be returned if
                                  the controller cannot distinguish when the NACK
                                  occurred.
  @retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED         The controller does not support the requested
                                  transaction. or The SPI controller was not able to support
                                  the frequency requested by ClockHz
